# TC-comp-1
The main repository for accessing challenges for the first architecture building competition in Turing Complete.  
Playing these challenges is as simple as putting the folders into your Turing Complete campaign folder, then loading them with the console. 

# Main Rules
This competition takes place in the Alpha branch, since it is the one that custom levels can be made for.  
There are two main phases in the state of this competition: [Before Challenge Reveal](main/README.md#bcr) and [After Challenge Reveal](main/README.md#acr).

### BCR:
  Only 'visible' challenges can be viewed and worked through (these are the ones available on the repo right now).  
  In this time, competitors should create their architecture and submit it to me (theoccupied) through private means (well, at least not anywhere public) using [this tool](https://github.com/MegaIng/tc-arch-extract) (requires Python 3.10+). Discord DMs are preferred but if you want to do this some other way that is fine as long as I'm aware of the method you're using.  
  Optionally, a competitor can also submit a custom level to be included ACR. Note that the level must be deemed 'reasonable' by me in order for it to be included. That means no bytecode that's suspiciously similar to your architecture's machine code.  

### ACR:
  Every challenge will be revealed, and every competitor must complete these challenges with the same architecture that they submitted, with no modifications apart from RAM contents.  
  After completing each challenge, competitors should submit their code and ISA that they used to complete the challenge. I will then run the architectures on more comprehensive tests on my end, to verify that the challenges have been satisfactorily completed using the same architecture.  
  Once every competitor has finished (or otherwise decided to stop), scores will be counted up as the sum of in-game scores (with modifications as according to the second section of rules) over all challenges.  
  The overall winner is the competitor that has the lowest total score (I may announce other places for outstanding/unique performances).  

All architectures must conform to the second section of rules below:

# Architecture Rules
This section is awaiting creation, and will be modified based on feedback. Generally, just don't use cheese. And be aware that RAM will probably be more expensive in this competition.
